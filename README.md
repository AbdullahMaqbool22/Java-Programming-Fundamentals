## Getting Started

These files are meant for beginners looking to learn Java programming. Familiarize yourself with the basics of Java and follow the exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Topics Covered

- Data Types and Variables
- Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
- Arrays and Collections
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- Test generations


## Usage
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local environment:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the latest version of JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.

### Setting up your Local Environment

1. **Install the JDK**:

   - Download and install the JDK following the instructions provided by Oracle or the distributor of your choice.

2. **Verify Installation**:

   - Open a command prompt or terminal and type the following command to verify that Java is properly installed:

     ```bash
     java -version
     ```

   This command should display information about the installed Java version.

### Running Java Files

1. **Using the Command Line**:

   - Open a command prompt or terminal.

   - Navigate to the directory containing the Java file you want to execute.

   - Use the `javac` command to compile the file:

     ```bash
     javac FileName.java
     ```

     Replace `FileName` with the actual name of your Java file.

   - If the compilation is successful, it will generate a `.class` file in the same directory.

   - Execute the compiled program using the `java` command:

     ```bash
     java FileName
     ```

     Again, replace `FileName` with the actual name of your Java file (without the `.java` extension).

2. **Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:

   - Alternatively, you can use an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

   - Open the IDE and create a new Java project.

   - Add the Java file to the project.

   - Click the "Run" or "Debug" button in the IDE to execute the program.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to save your Java files with a `.java` extension (e.g., `MyProgram.java`).

- Always handle exceptions and errors appropriately in your code.

- Feel free to explore and modify the provided files to deepen your understanding of Java programming.
